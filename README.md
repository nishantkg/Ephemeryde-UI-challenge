# Ephemeryde-UI-challenge
UI assignment for Ephemeryde
Ephemeryde UI challenge:

Create a webpage which shows a month calendar in a circular view. The days will be on the inner circumference and the dates will be on the outer circumference. The current date should be highlighted in red and it should change dynamically each day. Add a circular arc within the dates circle which denotes a event which lasts for a period (e.g 6th of the month to 15th of the month).

The total number of days on the calendar should be 42 always (this case: 1-31 May and 1-11 June). On changing the month the dates should reset.
 
A sample image is attached for you to get an idea how the calendar should look. In the image the current date is highlighted in red and the black line denotes the event which starts on 8th and ends on 24th. Ignore the orange dots in the image for now.  

Bonus problem:

Add styling to the calendar to make it aesthetically pleasing.
